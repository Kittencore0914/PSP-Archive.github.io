After the two articles last year about homebrew games (see [parts 1](https://psp-archive.github.io/games/Framerater-homebrews.html) and [2](https://psp-archive.github.io/games/Framerater-homebrews-2.html)), here's another list based on a FrameRater video. The guy is the only Youtuber to pay any attention to the PSP scene since well - the invention of Youtube?

In this case, we are dealing with a 70-minute video where he tests a seemingly endless amount of emulators running on the little Sony handheld. Each emulator gets an in-depth look, including obscure 8-bit systems and home computers from the 1980s. 

FrameRater assigns a rating to each emulator based on their performance and compatibility. He even reports the version number of the emulator he is testing - a significant detail, since some earlier versions actually work better than later iterations. If nothing else, you have to admire the dedication behind his work.
