Three months later, it's time to complete the overview of the homebrew games reviewed by Framerater. Read the first part [here](https://psp-archive.github.io/games/Framerater-homebrews.html) if you haven't already.

Rather than messing with the eLoader (as Framerater does in the video) I recommend using the [LME custom firmware](https://archive.org/details/release_660lme.7z) and the [LEDA](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/leda/releases) plugin. It works just as well as the Pro firmware for official games, and offers much better compatibility for homebrews, so I see no reason not to make the switch.

### gSquare

[gSquare](https://archive.org/details/gSquare.7z) is a puzzle game by Meastnt and Geecko.

### Fuzzy's World Space Golf 3D

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/FUZZ01258_00000.webp)

[Fuzzy's World Space Golf 3D](https://archive.org/details/fuzzys-world.-7z) by Mills. And yes, the Golf came first, [Space Ball](https://archive.org/details/spaceball.-7z) came out three years later (2015). Space Ball looks like a more polished version of Space Golf, but it was abandoned after only a handful of levels were implemented.

### Winnie the Pooh 

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/WINN01313_00000.webp)

[Winnie the Pooh](https://archive.org/details/winnie-the-pooh.-7z) by Team Atlantis and Andres1408.

### PSPMarble: Orchestra Sensation

[PSPMarble](https://archive.org/details/pspmarble.-7z)

### Mobile Assault

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/MOBI01397_00001.webp)

[Mobile Assault](https://archive.org/details/mobileassault.7z_202101) by Code Tactics. The game eventually became a paid iOS game, after which the devs (unsurprisingly) stopped updating the PSP version. Still, one of the better homebrews available on PSP.

### PSPMinesweeper

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/PSPM02163_00001.webp)

[PSPMinesweeper](https://archive.org/details/minesweeper.-7z_202101) One of a dozen such games (not quite, I found [only eleven](https://archive.org/details/psp-homebrew-library?query=minesweeper) so far), this version was created by Ryp.

### Dungeons: Assault Run

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/20210808084154.webp)

[Dungeons: Assault Run](https://archive.org/details/pspdar.-7z) by Charnold. The game looks more impressive when you consider that the dev created his own engine (and editor) from scratch. Charnold was another of many devs who abandoned the scene once the iPhone became popular. 

### Pong PSP

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/PONG00679_00000.webp)

The Pong game in the video seems to be [Pong PSP](https://archive.org/details/pong-psp.-7z) by Tutos14. Maybe. There are too many such games on PSP, and they all look samey.

### PSPcanon

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/PSPC00770_00000.webp)

[PSPcanon](https://archive.org/details/pspcanon.-7z) by Arknais_14. Pretty sure the title is supposed to be PSPcañón, since the whole game is in Spanish. The PSP didn't always play nice with diacritics, so many devs got around the problem by just omitting them.

### Left 4 Quake

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/LEFT01014_00000.webp)

[Left 4 Quake](https://archive.org/details/left-4-quake.-7z) by Ribcaged Entertainment. Another of the many 3D shooters running on a modified Quake engine, as the title gives away.

### Laser Survivor

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/LASE01690_00000.webp)

[Laser Survivor](https://archive.org/details/laser-survivor-psp.-7z) by Arthur42asse.

### PSP Rubik's Cube

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/RUBI00541_00000.webp)

[PSP Rubik's Cube](https://archive.org/details/psprubiks-cube-v-35.7z). This is another class of homebrews with many nearly identical games. This particular one was made by Exter.

### PSPSnake

[PSPSnake](https://archive.org/details/pspsnake-109216.7z) by Gambiting (Wojciech Musialkiewicz).

### Dave Gnukem

[Dave Gnukem](https://archive.org/details/daveGnukemPSP.7z) is one of many ports by Denis Televnyy (aka Deniska).

### Playstation Pool

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/PSPO00573_00000.webp)

[Playstation Pool](https://archive.org/details/pspool.-7z) by BlackPhoenix.

### rRootage

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/rrootage.webp)

[rRootage](https://archive.org/details/rRootage.7z) is a PC game by Japanese coder Kenta Cho. The game was at the centre of some rather lame [scene drama](http://lukasz.dk/mirror/forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopicd312.html?t=4301) in December 2005, when two developers ported in within a matter of days of each other. Deniska's port is lost, only the one from MrBrown survives.

### Serious Dungeons

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/SERI02036_00000.webp)

[Serious Dungeons](https://archive.org/details/serious-dungeons-v-0.5.7z) by Be3f. To answer Framerater's question in the video, the game runs on charnold's Dungeons Engine.

### Squarez

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/SQUA00555_00000.webp)

[Squarez](https://archive.org/details/squarez-v-0.8.1.7z) is an early homebrew game by Globware.

### Super Mario War

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/smwar.webp)

[Super Mario War](https://archive.org/details/smw.7z_202101) was ported to PSP by Percival and last updated in January 2007. The original Mario War was a DOS game! The Internet Archive has a copy [here](https://archive.org/details/mariowar).

### RoboTORN3D

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/ROBO00748_00000.webp)

[RoboTORN3D](https://archive.org/details/rt-3-d-06anonymoustipster.-7z) by AnonymousTipster was one of the earliest interactive 3D homebrews.

### Sandbox

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/SAND00719_00000.webp)

[Sandbox](https://archive.org/details/sandbox.-7z) by PSMonkey. The dev also made [Monkey 64](https://archive.org/details/monkey-64-0311.7z), the only PSP alternative to DaedalusX64.

### Zombie Crisis

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/ZCRI00711_00000.webp)

[Zombie Crisis](https://archive.org/details/30321-zcrisis-v-1.7z) by Shotspark Studios. This game seems to run on the PSP port of the Duke Nukem engine.

### SQRXZ 2 and 4

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/SQRX00476_00000.webp)

[SQRXZ 2](https://archive.org/details/sqrxz-2.7z) and [SQRXZ 4](https://archive.org/details/sqrxz-4.7z). The following few games are multiplatform ports of RetroGuru homebrews. As can be seen from the 4:3 aspect ratio, they weren't designed from the ground up for the PSP.

### Fruit'Y

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/FRUI00483_00000.webp)

[Fruit'Y](https://archive.org/details/fruity.-7z)

### Tiff exploit Snake

![Screenshot](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-Archive.github.io/raw/gh-pages/assets/img/snaps/SNAK00530_00000.webp)

Tiff exploits were the only way to play homebrews on PSPs with firmware 2.00 and above for a (short) time. None of those games are still playable, and nearly all were converted into normal homebrews eventually. 

The game in the video appears to be [Shine's Snake](https://archive.org/details/snake.7z_202104) by Shine and Gundrosen.
