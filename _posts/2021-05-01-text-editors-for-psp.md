Why would you ever want to use your PSP as a text editor? It doesn't have a touch screen. It doesn't have a keyboard. You can technically link up the very first PSP model with an infrared keyboard - if you can buy one from an antique shop. In other words, it will not be a very practical endeavor.

If you still want to go ahead and use an old videogaming device to train your writing skills, this is the app that I would suggest.

__PSPWrite__ was created by Ludovic Jacomme, better known as [Zx-81](http://zx81.zx81.free.fr/) - developer of countless emulators for PSP.

The on-screen keyboard is the Danzeff model, created by Danzel. It is the most practical input method you will find on PSP, and it's still pretty hard to use.

### IR keyboard

It really is possible to use one of those - at least according to this old YouTube video:
