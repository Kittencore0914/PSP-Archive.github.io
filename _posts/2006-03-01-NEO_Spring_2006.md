The coding competitions organised by [Neoflash.com](https://www.neoflash.com/) were the most important events of this kind in the PSP homebrew scene. 

Neoflash seems to have started business in 2005 - their first products were flash carts for the Nintendo DS. The Neoflash team arranged to hold the first homebrew coding competition during the same year. It seems fair to assume that the idea was to provide a legitimate application for what otherwise looks like a mere piracy-enabling device.

Only homebrews for the Nintendo DS were admitted at first, but the Spring 2006 edition changed that, by allowing apps (but not yet games) for PSP to enter the competition.
