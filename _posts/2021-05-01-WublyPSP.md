This is a port of a game created in the distant year 2005 by Jesse Venbrux (of Karoshi fame). Chocodino ported the game five years later - in 2010. Now's your turn to play it.

Controls are pretty wonky. There isn't much to do other than press the right button at the right time, but the art style is nice. Should be fun for a few minutes.
