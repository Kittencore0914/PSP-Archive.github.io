The [PSP Homebrew Game Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20141202131238/http://www.dashhacks.com/psp/dashhacks-contests/psp-homebrew-game-competition-2013-you-decide-the-best-psp-homebrew-of-2013/page-2.html) took place in November/December 2013.

This event was [poorly received](https://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=35137) at the time, due to some dubious decisions taken by the organisers.

This is obviously a modified version of [Batalla Ninja](https://archive.org/details/batalla.-ninja.v-2.5.7z), a homebrew from a different coder which was by then already four years old.
