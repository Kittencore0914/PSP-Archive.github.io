It runs like ass, but it runs. pspMame Deathrash is a modified version of PSPmame, with support for games the Japanese developer who created the original port might have cared less for. 

Like the Simpsons arcade game (featuring evil Smithers)!

Frame skip goes all the way up to 11 (literally), and with good reason. Most games run at a single-digit frame rate.

That's no reason to hate on Repuken2 - the developer. MAME is a demanding emulator to run, and the PSP has all the processing power of a late 1990s desktop computer. But play some older arcade games - and they will still be unplayable. This time, they run too fast. The speed-limit settings seem to have no effect on this. 

Still, pspMame Deathrash is the one way to play many of these games on a PSP, so it might still be worth your time.

To give any MAME emulator a fighting chance, you'll need to provide it with the correct ROMs. The .dat files, used in combination with an app like [RomCenter](https://www.romcenter.com/), will make sure you do just that.
