[GBAX2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050608032230/http://gbax.com/gbax2005/GBAX2005rr.html) was the first known coding competition with a PSP entry. The competition ended on 5 June 2005 - exactly a month after the first Hello World program for PSP, so it most likely was the first one ever.

Only one entry was a PSP game - much of the rest ran on GameBoy Advance, or GP32.
