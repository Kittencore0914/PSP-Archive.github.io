The eternal question about homebrew games: are any of them any good? Or less charitably - are there any homebrew games that aren't absolute trash? The eternal answer so far has been: we don't know. Other than Cave Story (which gets recommended every time the question crops up), few people had any knowledge of other good homebrews.

Few English-speaking people, at least. The guys from the PSPの大冒険 website reviewed over a hundred homebrew games over the arc of two years - here are their scores, along with links to the original reviews.
