Snes9x absolutely owns the SNES emulation scene on PSP. While for the NES there is the option between FCEU-based and Nester-based emulators, for the SNES there's very little to choose from. Every single build, every single RetroArch core, can all be traced back to 9X.

There are as many Snes9x forks for PSP as there are days in the year - trying to catalogue all of them would be pointless. Often, the changes were little more than tweaks to get the emulator to run on this or that firmware. For the PSP Homebrew Library, I collected twelve of the most significant forks.

Options 2 to 4 do... stuff. Discovering what exactly, is left as an exercise to the reader.
