Having a bad day? Pick up the Bible, open it on a random page and read the first verse you find:

"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more." - 2 Corinthians 7:7

I don't really understand what that means, but if you have your Elizabethan English game on point, perhaps the trick will indeed brighten your day. What if you don't have a Bible on you though? And your phone battery died, and so did every other digital device you own - except your PSP?

Enter **Good Bookr**, the homebrew app developed (not created, that would be blasphemous) by Phosphorous. It was updated multiple times over the years, most recently in 2012 - perhaps to reflect newly discovered Dead Sea scrolls?

In any case, the author did not forsake the public of international believers, having prepared translations in [Spanish](https://archive.org/details/goodbookr-1.2.1-spanish.-7z), [German](https://archive.org/details/goodbookr-1.2.1-german.-7z), [Dutch](https://archive.org/details/goodbookr-1.2.1-dutch.-7z) and [Tagalog](https://archive.org/details/goodbookr-1.2.1-tagalog.-7z). 

But not French.

If you have your doubts about the divinity of Christ - so what, the same goes for 90% of Christians. Reading the King James translation is still good training for when time travel will be invented - it might save you from being burnt at the stake for 'speaking in tongues' with your fancy 21st century lingo.

But if you still cannot be reconciled with the Jesus, you need not throw away your PSP. The developer Nassime made sure the words of Allah would be available to all in [PSP Quran](https://archive.org/details/pspquranv-4.0.7z), courtesy of the power of Holy Lua. 

Those whose religious interest lie even further east will be pleased by Sakya's [Dhammapada PSP](https://archive.org/details/dhammapada-psp.-7z), a collection of saying of the Buddha.
