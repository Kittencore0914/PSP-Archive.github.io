The MAME arcade emulator has been ported to PSP numerous times over the years. Not all ports are created equal, however, and Mame4All is one of the best.

PSP Mame4All was created by [TTYman](http://ttyman.free.fr/) and is based on MAME GP2X by Franxis, itself a port of MAME 0.34. The last release from the TTYman himself was 4.9r2 Hires, back in November 2007. 

The source code for version 5.1 was found by yours truly, late in 2020, on a rickety German website. It was compiled - with a lot of help from Sajattack - and distributed on Reddit. To the best of my knowledge, this version had never been circulated before.

According to the documentation, turning off the graphical elements in the menus saves 1Mb of memory. Given how ugly they were, I would have gladly disabled them regardless. If you want them back, the source code is in the [PSP Archive on GitHub](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/PSP-MAME4ALL), waiting to be compiled.

You can adjust the aspect ratio by pressing L+R. Pressing L, R and Start gets you a pause menu, from which you can exit the emulator. There aren't many options to choose from. Even so, the emulation runs pretty smoothly - making Mame4All a rarity among the arcade emulators for PSP. 

The release even includes a .dat file, to be used with programs like [RomCenter](https://www.romcenter.com/) to make sure the ROMs you'll be feeding to Mame4All will match the (rather ancient) romset of the emulator.
