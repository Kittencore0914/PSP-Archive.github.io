After Framerater, here's another streamer who got some views thanks to the camp appeal of PSP homebrews: Vinny of vinesauce.com. The video is from 2016, so the guy had the idea a couple of years earlier than Framerater apparently.

Watch our Vinny pay tribute to the amateur developers who spent weeks (if not months) coding free games in his "Vinny streams Shitty PSP Hombrew Games":

<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuOJHg1pi-E"
      width="600"
      height="400"
      frameborder="0"
      start="568"
      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>

This streamer didn't have a PSP apparently, so he resorted to emulation instead. Because of that, we get to watch him whine endlessly about random things happening when he presses a button, the resolution being wrong and so on.

If you play PSP homebrews on PPSSPP, remember to turn on software rendering in the settings and to download the official PSP fonts. Don't be like Vinny.

Here's the full list of featured games:
