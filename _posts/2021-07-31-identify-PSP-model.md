'PSP Slim' is a marketing term for the second revision of the first Sony handheld - the PSP 2000 (or 2001, 2004, etc., depending on the region where you bought it). 

The third hardware revision (series 3000) was nicknamed 'Slim & Lite' or 'Brite'.

But when it comes to homebrews only one distinction matters: is it the original 1000 model ('Fat') or anything else? The series 1000 is the only model to have 32Mb of RAM - all later revisions have twice as much memory. 

In a homebrew context, 'Slim' generally means any PSP model other than the first one.
