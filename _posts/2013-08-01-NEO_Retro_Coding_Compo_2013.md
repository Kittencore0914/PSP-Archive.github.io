The last of the NeoFlash coding competitions. The year 2014 would be the first without a PSP homebrew competition since the handheld's release.

Out of [27 entries](https://www.neoflash.com/go/index.php/2013/08/21/the-neo-retro-coding-compo-2013-is-closed-have-27-entries-total/), just two were meant to run on a PSP.
