This is one of the first PSP game jams mentioned anywhere on the web. It was set up by [PSPUpdates](https://web.archive.org/web/20051211145509/http://pspupdates.qj.net:80/2005/09/pspupdates-homebrew-contest-voting.html), one of the websites of the QuickJump videogame news network.

The seven entries include both games and applications, and do not seem to be ranked in any particular order.
