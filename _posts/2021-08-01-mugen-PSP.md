The only version of Mugen available on PSP (save [a proof of concept](https://archive.org/details/open-mugen-psp.-7z) from a guy named Kech) is known as [InfCat PSP M.U.G.E.N](https://archive.org/details/psp-m.-u.-g.-e.-n.-inf-cat.-7z).

This port was the work of the Japanese coder SofiyaCat, who created it before acquiring some amount of homebrew-scene fame for creating PSPTube, the original YouTube client for PSP.

Despite undergoing several revisions from May to December 2006, this port is not exactly polished. As the source code was never released, neither could anyone improve on it after SofiyaCat moved on to other projects.

The single-player mode is not exactly fun to play, due to an AI that goes from being hopelessly dumb to seemingly unbeatable and back, all in a matter of seconds. And while the port has a netplay mode, any attempt to get it to work results in an "Access Point error".

## How to add characters

The main value of this version of Mugen is found in the wackiness factor of mixing together completely mismatched characters. Say, Ranma versus Steve Jobs.

I downloaded the two from mugenarchive.com, and there are doubtless many other Mugen characters still around on the internet. Adding them to InfCat is less straightforward. 

This is the folder structure of InfCat:

```
PSP M.U.G.E.N. (InfCat)/
	├── CHARS/
	├── DATA/
	├── FONT/
	├── SOUND/
	├── STAGES/
	├── EBOOT.PBP
	└── History.txt
```

First, the name of the folder for the new character must be added to the file `select.def`, found under `DATA`. The character's folder must be then moved within `CHARS`. 

Make sure that the character folder includes the files `foldername.def` and `foldername.bin`. If either of them is missing, the game will crash at launch. If there is no `.bin` file, the easiest option is to copy it from another character.

The final directory structure should look something like:

```
PSP M.U.G.E.N. (InfCat)/
	├── CHARS/
	│   └── FOLDERNAME/	
	│   	├── FOLDERNAME.bin
	│   	└── FOLDERNAME.def
	├── DATA/
	├── FONT/
	├── SOUND/
	├── STAGES/
	├── EBOOT.PBP
	└── History.txt
```

Since this Mugen port is from 2006, you will need characters from the same era - anything too recent will not work, regardless of your efforts. You can check which Mugen version a character was intended for by reading the `mugenversion` line in the `foldername.def` file.

InfCat supports up to 10 characters. Any more than that, and you'll have to remove old ones from `select.def` in order to see the new.
