This isn't a settled argument, but after checking and archiving over 2,000 homebrews, I feel that I can hazard a guess on the matter.

The first homebrew of any kind is [hellopsp](https://archive.org/details/hellopsp_R1.7z) by Nem and Sampu-Syokunin, released on 5 May 2005. That much is well documented. But what about the first game?

Going through the PSPhacker.com archive (which later became QJ.net), the first homebrew game was [a Tetris clone](https://web.archive.org/web/20050512020947/http://www.psphacker.com/index.html) released by the Austrian coder team [FragLab](https://www.fraglab.at/) five days later, on 10 May.

And yet, a look at the [PSP用アプリ](https://web.archive.org/web/20050524143511/http://psp.holybell.to/index.php?PSP%CD%D1%A5%A2%A5%D7%A5%EA) wiki reveals the existence of [Simple Turn](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510235947/http://www.nurs.or.jp:80/~calcium/wearable/index.html), a Japanese homebrew game released on the same date.

Whichever came first - the Japanese or the Austrian - they're now both archived.
