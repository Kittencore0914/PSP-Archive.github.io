The PSP Archive is managed by the PSP Homebrew Discord community. Our only affiliation to Sony is having bought some of their products.

### Project overview

- [PSP-Archive on GitHub](https://github.com/PSP-Archive): collects source code for PSP homebrews;
- [PSP Homebrew Library on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/psp-homebrew-library): collects all homebrews ever made, even the ones that are objectively pretty bad;
- PSP Archive on GitHub Pages: a nice way to present the worthier brews.
